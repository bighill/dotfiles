# Neovim with lua

```bash
ln -s ~/github/cheatcodes/vim/dot_config_slash_nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

## About

This approach uses lua for a more advanced config situation

Current features
- theme
- example key shortcuts
- LSP for common languages
- NerdTree

I'm not sure I'm excited about this. But saving it in case I feel inspired to come back to it.
